## How to create a Lobby with questions?
Go to https://vote.sovd.it/create. There you can configure the lobby. When you finished with that you can scan the QR Code on that page and join the lobby as the HOST.
<br/>
<br/>
Now you see a lobby code, when you are connected to the server. This lobby code is needed to set up the presentation mode (ask-page). For that visit: `https://vote.sovd.it/ask?lobby=<lobby-code>`
<br/>
<br/>
Now you see a QR code on the ask page which your participants can scan to join the lobby as voter. They will be linked to `https://vote.sovd.it/vote?lobby=<lobby-code>`
<br/>
<br/>
Now the host can start the presentation, reset votes, insert custom questions and he can close the lobby, which leads to that all voters will be redirected to this page: `https://vote.sovd.it/submit`
<br/>
Here they can enter their name and email address if they liked the presentation and are interested apply for a job.
